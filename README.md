# Ny Media patches

This is just a collection of patches for packages (most likely Drupal.org modules) that aren't hosted officially anywhere. They're hosted here in a public repository so that we can download and apply them when installing our composer projects.

NB: Patches placed here are supposed to be temporary until the patched issue is fixed or we can replace the patch with one hosted officially somewhere.

To add a new patch just add it to this repository and then you can link to it using:  
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nymedia/patches/master/{name_of_your_patch.patch}
